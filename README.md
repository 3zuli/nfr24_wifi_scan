# nfr24_wifi_scan
nRF24-based 2.4GHz scanner with Arduino

Original code by Rolf Henkel at Arduino-Info: https://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/Nrf24L01-Poor+Man's+2.4+GHz+Scanner

This is a modified version, which scans all 125 channels supported by the nRF24L01+ chip. I also changed the "greyscale" to output numbers instead.
